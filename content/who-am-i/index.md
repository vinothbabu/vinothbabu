In short, my name is Vinoth babu Mahadevan from Chennai, RajiniKanth fan.I am avid football and chess player. Some of my thoughts: 

> When the chess pieces change, the game changes. You can’t expect the game not to change, and keep referring back to when the pieces interacted differently with eachother, dragging that into today’s geopolitical landscape. It’s a fast paced geopolitical landscape out there, and no one is looking back
>
> Before anybody criticize, ask yourself this question, was there a better alternative? No plan is perfect, it’s easy to pick out faults, but harder to bring to table a better alternative
